\section{What is factorization homology? [09/20/17]}

What is factorization homology? We can describe it in two ways. If it 
were an animal, I'd first describe how it's distributed over the face of the earth.
Next we will describe its phylogeny -- how it evolved from single-celled organisms.
For the moment you can think of factorization algebra as a sort of 
generalized-(co)sheaf-homology. This expression can be hyphenated in both ways.
More specifically, it is a machine/assembly line that takes two inputs:
one from geometry $M$ , and one from algebra $A$. The output is
the factorization homology of $M$ $\int_M A$ with coefficients in $A$.


\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Homology.} Here $M$ is a topological space and $A$ is an abelian group.
        In this case the output is a chain complex
        \begin{equation*}
            \int_M A \simeq \HH_\bullet(M,A),
        \end{equation*}
        quasiisomorphic to singular homology with coefficients in $A$.
        \marginnote{John: What is a theorem you can't prove without ordinary homology?}

    \item  \textbf{Hochschild homology.} Here $M$ is a one-dimensional manifold and $A$
        will be an associative algebra. In this case
        \begin{equation*}
            \int_{S^1} A \simeq HH_\bullet A,
        \end{equation*}
        the Hochschild homology of $A$.
        You might be less familiar with this algebraic object than ordinary
        homology. It's importance comes from how it underlies trace methods
        in algebra (e.g. characteristic 0 representations of finite groups).
        Hochschild homology is a recipient of ``the universal trace'' and hence
        an important part of associative algebra. Note that
        $HH_0A=A/[A,A]$.
        
    \item \textbf{Conformal field theory.} This is in some sense the real starting point
        for the ideas we will develop in this class. Here $M$ is a smooth complete etc.
        algebraic curve over $\C$ and $A$ is a vertex algebra. In this case
        the output $\int_M A$ was constructed by Beilinson and Drinfeld, and
        is known as chiral homology of $M$ with coefficients in $A$. It is
        a chain complex, with $\HH_0(\int_M A)$ being the conformal blocks of
        the conformal field theory.

    \item \textbf{Algebraic curves over $\F_q$.} Here $M$ is an algebraic curve over $\F_q$
        and $G$ is a connected algebraic group over $\F_q$. In this case $\int_MG$ is known
        as the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian, and is a stack. One interesting
        property that it has is that
        \begin{equation*}
            \HH_\bullet(\int_M G,\bar\Q_\ell) \simeq \HH_\bullet(\text{Bun}_G(M),\bar\Q_\ell).
        \end{equation*}
        Although the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian is more complicated, it is
        more easily manipulated. This equivalence is a form of non-Abelian
        Poincar\'e duality.

        In particular, one might be interested in computing
        \begin{equation*}
            \chi(\text{Bun}_G(M)) = \sum_{[P]}\frac{1}{|\Aut(P)|},
        \end{equation*}
        which makes sense over a finite field. The computation of this quantity is
        known as Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers.

    \item \textbf{Topology of mapping spaces.} Now $M$ is an $n$-manifold without boundary and $A$ will be an
        $n$-fold loop space, $A=\Omega^nZ=\Maps( (D^n,\partial D^n),(Z,*))$. The
        output is a space weakly homotopy equivalent to $\Maps_c(M,Z)$ if $\pi_iZ=0$ for $i<n$.
        This is also known as nonabelian Poincar\'e duality. Again the left hand
        side is more complicated but more easily manipulated.

    \item \textbf{$n$-disk algebra (perturbative TQFT).}
        Here $M$ is an $n$-manifold and $A$ is an $n$-disk algebra (or an $E_n$-algebra)
        in chain complexes. The output is a chain complex and has some sort of interpretation
        in physics. One thinks of $A$ as the algebra of observables on $\R^n$, and
        $\int_M A$ is the global observables (in some derived sense). In a rough
        cartoon of physics, one assigns to opens sets of observables, and a way to copmute
        expectation values. Factorization homology puts together local observables to global
        observables:
        \begin{equation*}
            \text{Obs}(M) \simeq \int_M A.
        \end{equation*}
        if we are working in perturbative QFT.

    \item \textbf{TQFT.} Here $M$ is an $n$-manifold (maybe with a framing) and $A$ is an
        $(\infty,n)$-category (enriched in $\mathcal{V}$).
        The output is a space (if enriched, an object of $\mathcal{V}$), which
        is designed to remove the assumptions from the examples above.
\end{enumerate}

Next class we'll go over how one might have come up with factorization homology
if one didn't know all of mathematics. We will focus in this class in learning
factorization as a \textbf{tool}, instead of aiming to reach some fancy theorem.
We will start with the examples of the topology of mapping spaces.

\textbf{Pax:} What is the physical interpretation of the first and second chiral
homologies? \textbf{John:} One might be interested in things like Wilson lines,
where these higher homology groups come into play.

\section{How to come up with factorization homology yourself [09/22/17]}

Last time we went over where in mathematics one might encounter factorization homology.
This time we'll go over how you might come up with it yourself. Consider the following
thought experiment. Suppose you want to study objects in some context $\mathcal{M}$.
Unfortunately objects here are pretty hard in general. Inside $\mathcal{M}$, however,
we have $\mathcal{D}\subset \mathcal{M}$ which are particulary simple, and everything else
in $\mathcal{M}$ is built out of objects in $\mathcal{D}$.

Let's consider the example where $\mathcal{M}$ is a nice category of (homotopy types of)
topological spaces. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the single point, i.e. all contractible spaces.
To study $\mathcal{M}$ we might map functors out of it. Let's start with $\mathcal{D}$
instead. Consider $\Fun(*, \mathcal{V})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is some category where
our invariants will live. Of course this is canonically just $\mathcal{V}$. How do we 
extend to $\mathcal{M}$? We have a restriction map
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \Fun(*,\mathcal{V}) \rar{ev_*} & \Fun(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{V}).
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
We look for a left adjoint to this restriction functor $ev_*$ (John: if you don't know what
a left-adjoint is you should learn it because I won't tell you. -laughter-. No, I'm not joking, -laughs-).
There are two different
things we could do. We could ignore the homotopy-ness of everything, and take the naive
left-adjoint. If, say $\mathcal{V}$ is the category of chain complexes, this naive
left-adjoint produces a stupid answer depending on our precise statement. Suppose by $\mathcal{M}$
we meant the homotopy category of spaces (where objects are spaces and maps are sets of
homotopy classes of maps). Then we are extending
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        *\rar{A}\dar & \mathcal{V}\\
        \text{hoSpaces}\urar[dashed]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
A naive left-adjoint would take a space $X$ to the stupid answer $A^{\oplus \pi_0X}$.
Similarly if we take $\mathcal{M}$ to be spaces and all continuous maps, $X$ would
be sent to $A^{\oplus X}$ here by $X$ we mean the set of elements of $X$.

There is a notion of a derived or homotopy left-adjoint. Suppose now by $\mathcal{M}$
we mean the topological category of spaces, where the mapping sets are spaces equipped
with the compact-open topology. Now we take a \textit{homotopy} Kan extension. This
fancy left-adjoint will now send a space $X$ to the the chain complex $C_*(X, A)$
(up to equivalence). Hence we see that we can recover homology from this paradigm
of extending a simpler invariant to the whole category.

How do we choose what $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ are? Suppose we want to study
$\mathcal{F}(M)$ for $M\in\mathcal{M}$. For concreteness, let's say we're studying
manifolds. The most basic question to ask: is there a local-to-global principle for
$\mathcal{F}$? The simplest case is for $\mathcal{F}$ to be a sheaf, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \mathcal{F}(M) \rar & \lim_{U\in\mathcal{U}} \mathcal{F}(U).
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
If so you don't need factorization homology, and you can just leave. -laughter-.

For instance, consider $\mathcal{F}=C_*(\Maps(\cdot, Z))$ taking spaces to chain
complexes. Is this a sheaf? Well if we forget about $C_*$, we get a sheaf, as a
map into $Z$ is the same as giving maps on subsets agreeing on overlaps. What does
taking chains do? Well notice that
\begin{align*}
    C_*(\Maps(U\sqcup V,Z)) &= C_*(\Maps(U,Z)\times\Maps(V,Z)\\
    &= C_*(\Map(U,Z)) \otimes C_*(\Maps(V,Z)).
\end{align*}
This is not a sheaf because in this case tensor products and direct sums are never
the same! (why?) So what can we do? We need to change what we consider $\mathcal{D}$ to be.

Idea: to study $\mathcal{F}$ maybe there are more general arrangements of
$\mathcal{D}\subset\mathcal{M}$ such that local-to-global principles still apply, without
$\mathcal{F}$ being a sheaf.

The following problem will guide us for the next few weeks. Let $M$ be a manifold
and let $Z$ be a space.

\textbf{Problem:} calculate (or provide tools for computing) $H_*\Maps(M,Z)$.

\begin{definition}
    Let $\mathsf{Mfld}_n$ be the (ordinary) category of smooth $n$-manifolds, with
    $\Hom(M,N)$ is the set of smooth embeddings of $M$ into $N$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\mathcal{M}\mathsf{FD}_n$ be the topological category of smooth $n$-manifolds, with
    $\Maps(M,N)$ the space of smooth embeddings of $M$ into $N$, equipped with the
    compact open smooth topology.
\end{definition}

To read about this topology, c.f. Hirsch's book
on differential topology \cite{hirsch}. Roughly, convergence is both pointwise and also
pointwise convergence of all derivatives.
For instance one might take a knot and tighten it until it turns into just
a line. This would converge in the usual compact-open topology. However, in
the smooth topology, these would not converge as we would be creating sharp
kinks. In particular $\pi_0\text{Emb}(S^1,\R^3)$ is very different from
$\pi_0\text{Emb}^\text{top}(S^1,\R^3)$.

\begin{definition}
    We define the category $\mathbf{Disk}_n$ to be the full subcategory of
    $\mathbf{Mfd}_n$ where the objects are finite disjoint unions of standard
    Euclidean spaces $\sqcup_I\R^n$. Similalry the category $\mathbf{DISK}_n$
    is the full topological subcategory of $\mathbf{MFD}_n$ where the objects
    are finite disjoint unions of Euclidean space.
\end{definition}

Observe that $\Maps_{\mathbf{DISK}_n}(\R^n,\R^n)=\text{Emb}(\R^n,\R^n)$.
\begin{lemma}
    The map $\text{Emb}(\R^n,\R^n)\to GL_n(\R)$ given by differentiating
    is a homotopy equivalence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
    Shrink the embedding\ldots and that's really it. There is an obvious inclusion going
    the other way, and the composite is the identity. If we shrink our embedding
    down to zero, we obtain a deformation retraction onto $GL_n(\R)$. In particular,
    given an embedding $\phi$ and a vector $v\in\R^n$, look at $\phi(v/t)$ as $t\to\infty$.
\end{proof}

This should fill you with hope -- we can understand the automorphism spacess of the
building block objects as up to homotopy just finite dimensional manifolds (general
linear or orthogonal groups). In particular, one should think of the $n$-disks as
some sort of algebra.

\begin{definition}
    An $n$-disk algebra in $\mathcal{V}$ is a symmetric monoidal functor
    $A:\mathbf{DISK}_n\to\mathcal{V}$.
\end{definition}

Our first goal in this class is to understand $\HH_*\Maps(M,Z)$ using $n$-disk
algebras and factorization homology.

Question from someone: what's the relation with $E_n$-algebras? John: It turns
out that $E_n$-algebras are equivalent to $n$-disk algebras with framing.

Question from Tochi: what if you work with manifolds with boundary? John: well
if you require boundaries to map to boundaries you can make the same definitions.
You then have to work with Euclidean spaces and half-spaces.

\section{Framed embeddings [09/25/17]}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{framing} of an $n$-manifold $M$ is an isomorphism of vector bundles
    $TM \cong M\times \R^n$.
\end{definition}

Of course, not all manifolds have framings. For instance, (as an exercise) one
can check that all (compact oriented) two-manifolds except for $S^1\times S^1$ do not admit framings.
You might use the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem, which expresses the Euler characteristic
as a sum of the index of the zeroes of a vector field $v$ on $M$ that has isolated
zeroes. Hence if $M$ is framed, the Euler characteristic of $M$ must be zero.

Here is an example that John does not know how to prove without the use of homology.
Pax: isn't there a later proof of this via geometric methods by Kirby? John: well ok
I didn't mean it as a logical statement that it can't be proved without.
\begin{theorem}[Whitney or Wu]
    Every orientable three-manifold admits a framing.
\end{theorem}

Notice that any Lie group has a framing, as one takes a basis for the Lie algebra
and pushes it forward by the group action. On the other hand, manifolds of dimension
four generally do not have framings (at least in John's experience).

We can ask the following question: what is a framed open embedding? There are a few options.
The naive (strict) option is that if we have an open embedding $M\hookrightarrow N$ of
framed manifolds, since the pullback of $TN$ is $TM$, we have two different trivializations
of $TM$. We might ask that the map induced $M\times\R^n\to M\times\R^n$ is the identity.

Okay, let's think about framed embeddings. Embeddings are very flexible -- you can stretch
them and twist them. But strict framed embeddings are very rigid. For instance, they are
automatically isometries (giving the fibers the usual Euclidean metric). But there aren't
very many isometric embeddings into a compact manifold. So this options is not what we
will be interested in working with.

Let's consider a more lax/homotopy-theoretic option. Thinking slightly differently, recall
that the tangent bundle is classified by a map $TM: M\to \Gr_n\R^\infty$. This map is
of course only defined up to homotopy. That's fine, just choose a representative. Over
the infinite Grassmannian we have the Stiefel manifold $V_k(\R^\infty)\to\Gr_n\R^\infty$.
Choosing a lift
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \; & V_n\R^\infty \dar \\
        M \rar{TM}\urar[dashed]{\phi_M} & \Gr_n\R^\infty
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
is precisely the data of a framing. Suppose now that an embedding $M\hookrightarrow N$
where $M,N$ are framed by $\phi_M$ and $\phi_N$.
The lax definition of a framed embedding is now going to be extra data: an embedding
together with a homotopy between the framings $\phi_M$ and $\phi_N|_M$.


\begin{definition}
    The space of framed embeddings $\Emb^{fr}(M,N)$ is the homotopy pullback
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Emb^{fr}(M,N) \rar\dar & \Emb(M,N)\dar  \\
            \Maps_{V_n\R^\infty}(M,N) \rar & \Maps_{\Gr_n\R^\infty}(M,N)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    In particular a framed embedding is an embedding $M\hookrightarrow N$ and
    a homotopy in $\Map_{\Gr_n\R^\infty}(M,N)$ between the images along both maps.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
    Check that $V_n\R^\infty\simeq *$.
\end{exercise}

It looks like we've made things more complicated, whereas framings should have made
things simpler. Let's check that it is. Let's calculate $\Emb^{fr}(\R^n, \R^n)$.
By definition, this sits in the following diagram
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \Emb^{fr}(\R^n, \R^n) \rar\dar & \Emb(\R^n, \R^n)\dar \\
        \Maps_{V_n\R^\infty}(\R^n, \R^n) \rar & \Maps_{\Gr_n\R^\infty}(\R^n,\R^n).
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
Notice that the bottom left object is homotopy equivalent to $\Maps_*(\R^n,\R^n)\simeq *$.
The bottom right space is homotopy equivalent to the loop space $\Omega\Gr_n\R^\infty\simeq \Omega BO(n)\simeq O(n)$.
From last time, $\Emb(\R^n,\R^n)\simeq \Diff(\R^n)\simeq GL(n)\simeq O(n)$ (this is
\textbf{homework 1}). Now the vertical map on the right is a homotopy equivalence.
This implies (by some machinery) that the vertical map on the left is an equivalence.
We conclude that $\Emb^{fr}(\R^n,\R^n)\simeq *$. The rest of \textbf{homework 1} is to
show that $\Emb(\R^n, N)$ is homotopy equivalent to the frame bundle of $TN$. Applying this
to the diagram above where we replace the second copy of $\R^n$ with $N$, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \Emb^{fr}(\R^n, N) \rar\dar & \Emb(\R^n, N)\dar \\
        \Maps_{V_n\R^\infty}(\R^n, N) \rar & \Maps_{\Gr_n\R^\infty}(\R^n,N).
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
Now the same argument will show that the vertical map on the right is an equivalence,
and that the map of the left is an equivalence. It follows now that $\Emb^{fr}(\R^n,N)\simeq N$.
Hence we see that we are replacing the role of the orthogonal group by that of a point.

The point of adding these framings is that it will allow for an easier transition between
algebra and topology.
\begin{definition}
    We define the category $\mathbf{DISK}_n^{rect}$ to be a topological category with objects
    finite disjoint unions of open unit disks, with morphisms being embeddings that are compositions
    of translations and dilations. These embeddings are what we call rectilinear embeddings.
\end{definition}
These embeddings are easy to analyze (we've given the space the obvious space of pointwise
convergence). This space of embeddings from a single disk to a single disk is a contractible
subspace of $D^n\times\R_{>0}$ (just move to the origin and expand outwards). More generally,
one checks that rectilinear embeddings $\Emb^{rect}(\sqcup_k D^n, D^n)$ maps to
$\Conf_k(D^n)$ and that this map is a homotopy equivalence.

\begin{proposition}
    There is a homotopy equivalence $\mathbf{DISK}_n^{rect}\simeq \mathbf{DISK}_n^{fr}$.
\end{proposition}


\section{Homotopy pullbacks and framing [09/27/17]}

\begin{definition}
    Suppose we have a map $X\to B$ together with a point $*\in B$, the homotopy fiber
    of $X\to B$ over $*\in B$ is the fiber product $\{*\}\times_B\Maps([0,1], B)\times_B X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    The formation of homotopy fibers is homotopy invariant. More precisely, given an weak
    equivalence of spaces $X\to X'$ over $B$ a pointed space via maps $f$ and $g$,
    then the homotopy fiber of $f$ is weak equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $g$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We can use the long exact sequence of a Serre fibration.
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \hofiber(f)\dar \ar[rr] & \; & \hofiber(g)\dar \\
            \Maps([0,1],B)\times_B X \ar[rr]\drar & \; & \{*\}\times_B\Maps([0,1],B)\ar[dl] \\
            \; & B & 
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    Some argument about homotopy equivalences allows us to conclude that $\pi_*\hofiber(f)\cong\pi_*\hofiber(g)$.
\end{proof}


\textbf{Homework 2}: homotopy pullbacks are homotopy invariant

Recall last time we were discussing $\Maps_B(M,N)$ for some space $B$. This objects
is defined to be the homotopy fiber
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \Maps_B(M,N) \rar\dar & \Maps(M,N) \dar \\
        * \rar & \Maps(M,B)
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
Now by homotopy invariance we can argue that $\Maps_{V_n\R^\infty}(M,N)\simeq \Maps(M,N)$
since $V_n\R^\infty\simeq*$. Hopefully this fills in some of the gaps from last lecture.

Let us now return to our assertion from last time.
\begin{proposition}
    There is a functor $\mathbf{DISK}_n^{rect}\to \mathbf{DISK}_n^{fr}$ which is a homotopy
    equivalence.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Notice that we can just calculate from last time,
    \begin{equation*}
        \Emb^{fr}(\R^n, \R^n) \simeq * \simeq \Emb^{rect}(D^n, D^n).
    \end{equation*}
    More generally, consider $\Emb^{rect}(\sqcup_I D^n, \sqcup_J D^n)=\sqcup_{\pi:I\to J}\prod_J\Emb^{rect}(\sqcup_{\pi^{-1}(j)}\R^n,\R^n)$.
    So it suffices to show that $\Emb^{fr}(\sqcup_I\R^n,\R^n)\simeq\Emb^{rect}(\sqcup D^n, D^n)$.
    Recall that $\ev_0:\Emb^{rect}(\sqcup_I D^n,D^n)\to \Conf_I(D^n)$ is a homotopy
    equivalence, which we argued last time. Returning to our homotopy pullback square
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Emb^{rect}(\sqcup_I \R^n, \R^n) \rar\dar & \Emb(\sqcup_I\R^n,\R^n)\dar \\
            *\simeq \Maps_{EO(n)}(\sqcup_I \R^n,\R^n) \rar & \Maps_{BO(n)}(\sqcup_I \R^n,\R^n)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    notice that
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \text{Fr}(TM)\simeq \Emb(\R^n, M)\dar{\ev_0} & \Emb( (\R^n,0), (M,x))\lar\dar \simeq O(n) \\
            M & \{x\}\lar
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    Likewise
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Emb(\sqcup_I \R^n, M)\dar{\ev_0} & \prod_I O(n)\lar \dar\\
            \Conf_I(M) & \{x_1,\ldots,x_I\}\lar
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    Hence $\Maps_{BO(n)}(\sqcup\R^n,\R^n)\simeq \prod_I\Maps_{BO(n)}(\R^n,\R^n)\simeq\prod_IO(n)$.

    Up to homotopy, we now obtain
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Emb^{fr}(\sqcup\R^n,\R^n) \rar\dar & \Conf_I(\R^n)\times \prod_I O(n)\dar \\
            * \rar & \prod_I O(n)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    so we conclude that $\Emb^{fr}(\sqcup_I\R^n,\R^n)\simeq \Conf_I(\R^n)$ which concludes
    the proof of the proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Consider the case $n=1$. What do the framed and rectilinear embeddings look like in this case?
    Notice that $\Emb^{fr}(\sqcup_I \R^1,\R^1)\simeq \Conf_I(\R^1)$ is discrete up to
    homotopy, and identified noncanonically with the symmetric group on $I$ letters.
\end{example}

Recall a definition from the first day.
\begin{definition}
    An $\mathcal{E}_n$ algebra in $\mathcal{V}$ is a symmetric monoidal functor
    $\mathbf{DISK}_n^{rect,\sqcup} \to \mathcal{V}^\otimes$.
\end{definition}
Next time we will see that $\mathcal{E}_1$-algebras are, in a suitable sense,
equivalent to associative algebras.
